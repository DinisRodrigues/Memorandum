We travelled to Mirandela, where we met a jeweler, Mr. Mário, on the 16th April of 2019. We visited his store where he has been working since the age of 11, and where he told us more about his life.

During his youth he played football, was part of Mirandela’s philharmonic and learnt to repair watches. His attitude towards life, having taken every opportunity given to him, was, without a doubt, a great inspiration for us.

You can learn more about Mr. Mário on our fifth <a style="text-decoration: none; background-color: #C8F7C5; color: black; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;" href="/videos#ten">video</a>.
