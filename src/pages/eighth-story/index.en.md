We met Mr. Fernando Santos on the 15th April of 2019. Mr. Fernando owns one of the last antique bookstores in Braga. His story is hidden in a small shopping center in the central area of the city. Walking into his “library”, we came across books from floor to ceiling, in whichever direction we’d look, feeling the familiar smell of old books simultaneously. 

Mr. Fernando is a tranquil, wry witted man. He told us about how he got into his trade – at a young age – because he did not want to continue his studies. And so, what at the beginning was just a regular job, became, as his life continued, a passion.
Nevertheless, his life is not cannot be summed up of only books, Porto wine is something that motivates him as well. He spends his time between his store and his vines by the Douro river.
