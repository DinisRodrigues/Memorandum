We met Mrs. Inês, a baker from Mirandela, on the 16th April of 2019. We found her bakery in the historic part of the city. Her energy and passion for her work, was something we quickly caught wind of. She knows the traditional breadmaking process better than anyone, and still makes her bread that way.

It was not easy to spend some time with Mrs. Inês, her bakery is always bustling with customers. However, this way we were able to not only learn more about her bakery, but also of the good mood it transmits to her customers.

At the end of our conversation with Mrs. Inês, we could not resist the appetizing smell of her bread, leaving there with a large sample of her art to take home.
