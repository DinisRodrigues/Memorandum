Our link to Mrs. Maria, can be considered cheating, as one of our team members is her grandaughter, however, when we met her on the 22th March of 2019, we did not treat her story with any less professionalism. The only difference, in this case was, at the end of shooting the episode we were treated to a snack. 

Mrs. Maria is retired, these days weaving only occupies her thoughts, as she considers herself to have too much free time. Visiting her was like going back in time, remembering childhood games that are still familiar to us. We got to know her three passions: dancing, weaving, and later her daughters, whom she is very proud of.

We learnt Mrs. Maria is quite attached to her family and her craft, and because of that she confessed that one day “I only want to be remembered as a good daughter, good mother, and good person”.

You can learn more about Mrs. Maria in our second <a style="text-decoration: none; background-color: #C8F7C5; color: black; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;" href="/en/videos#four">episode.</a>
