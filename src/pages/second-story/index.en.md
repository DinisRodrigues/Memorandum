We met Mr. Arménio Varela, a craftsman from Famalicão a small parish, just outside Nazaré,  on the 29th March of 2019, until then we only knew about his wonderful work as a craftsman. As soon as we arrived at his store we were very well welcomed, and he had a lot of stories to share.

We saw countless pieces of his handicrafts, either in rattan, bamboo, club rush or wood, and we realized that, fortunately, we were not the first to discover his talent. Mr. Arménio is recognised internationally and has a large body of work, but even so he found some time to tell us his experiences in this world, that he doesn’t view as his own.

Beyond his store, by the main street of Famalicão, we also visited his workshop. There we saw his old looms, which he still works with to make his pieces in rattan, and several pieces of driftwood that he acquires.

And after using approximately 2 hours of his time for the recording of his story, he treated us to some coffee afterwards.

You can find out more about Mr. Arménio on our first <a style="text-decoration: none; background-color: #C8F7C5; color: black; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;" href="/en/videos#two">episode</a>.
