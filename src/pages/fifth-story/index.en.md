Our interview with Mrs. Fátima was one of the most impressive, during our journey. We met her on the 16th April of 2019. Mrs. Fátima is one of the last wool weavers in Portugal. What impressed us the most was, not only the wool’s transformation process – which is quite slow, requires the use of machinery and much concentration even for an experienced weaver like Mrs. Fátima –, as also the complete process after the wool is ready to be worked into carpets. 

And even though this tradition is disappearing, Mrs. Fátima continues to be very successful and very busy with orders not only in Portugal but also overseas. We hope her work impresses you as much as it impressed us.
