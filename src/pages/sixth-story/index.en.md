We met with Mrs. Júlia and Mr. Zé on the 30th March of 2019, or to be truthful, we interviewed Inês’ grandparents on the 30th March of 2019. This was another of our interviews with benefits, as we were treated to lunch before work. 

Mr. and Mrs. Costa are farmers from the Ribatejo area who are still very much in love. We spent more time with Ms. Júlia, as their farm life does not allow for large breaks. While Mr. Zé was grazing their herd of goats, we learnt a bit more about both their lives, the struggles they had during their childhoods, and the peaceful life they lead, these days.

You can learn more about Mrs. Júlia and Mr. Zé on our third <a style="text-decoration: none; background-color: #C8F7C5; color: black; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;" href="/en/videos#six">video</a>.
