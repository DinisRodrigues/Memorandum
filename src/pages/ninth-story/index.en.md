We ventured to the Manuel Firmino market, in Aveiro, where we met Mrs. F치tima and Ms. Rita, on the 20th March of 2019. They have worked here for over 40 years and are one of the last stands in the market to continue in business, selling fresh produce.

As the years have gone by there have been less customers, and even though their workload is heavy, the two sisters have no intentions in quitting.
