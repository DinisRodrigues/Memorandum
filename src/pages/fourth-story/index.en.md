We met Mr. Edgar on 30th March of 2019 but finding him was not easy. We had to contact right people, and use our GPS, because Perofilho is not easy to come across.

At first, we were unsure about walking into someone’s house, with no previous knowledge of anyone while also interrupting their afternoon, was quite awkward, however, we quickly realized Mr. Edgar was a very sweet person. We were as anxious to hear his story, as he was to tell it.

And so, we got to know his workshop, his tools, not as modern as they once were, and his faithful work companion, his radio.

He was without a doubt one of most comical and lively people, we had interviewed, his joy in explaining his mishaps as a child and his misadventures as an adult immediately captivated us.
